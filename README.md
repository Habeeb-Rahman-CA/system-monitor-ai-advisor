### 🤖 AI Performance Advisor

A built-in intelligent advisor that analyzes your system metrics and provides actionable recommendations.

#### Rule-Based Engine
- Detects **CPU overload**, **RAM pressure**, **high disk usage**, and **overheating**
- Monitors individual process behavior (e.g., Chrome memory consumption)
- Auto-runs every **10 seconds** with a computed **Health Score (0–100)**
- Advice cards categorized by severity: 🔴 Critical · 🟡 Warning · 🔵 Info · 🟢 Good

#### Local AI (LLM) Mode
- Runs **100% offline** using [WebLLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm) with WebGPU acceleration
- Choose from multiple models:
  - **LLaMA 3.2 1B** — Fast (~0.6 GB)
  - **LLaMA 3.2 3B** — Smarter (~1.8 GB)
  - **Phi 3.5 Mini** — Balanced (~2.0 GB)
  - **Gemma 2 2B** — Google (~1.5 GB)
  - **Mistral 7B** — Powerful (~4.0 GB)
- Models download once and run entirely locally — no cloud dependency
- Streaming response preview while the LLM is thinking

### 🎨 UI & Design

- **Glassmorphism Design** — Translucent panels with backdrop-filter blur and saturation
- **Dark & Light Themes** — One-click toggle with smooth animated transitions
- **Ambient Orb Animations** — Floating gradient orbs for a premium, Apple-inspired aesthetic

- **Fade-In Animations** — Cards and panels gracefully animate into view
- **Slide-In Advisor Panel** — AI advisor slides in from the right with backdrop overlay

### 🪟 Window Controls

- **Mini Mode** — Compact overlay showing essential metrics, perfect for gaming or multitasking
- **Always-on-Top** — Pin the window above all other applications
- **Custom Window Chrome** — Frameless window with native drag region

### 🔔 Smart Alerts

- Automatic threshold-based alerts for critical system events:
  - CPU usage > 90%
  - RAM usage > 90%
  - CPU temperature > 85°C
  - Disk usage > 95%
- Toast-style alert notifications with dismiss buttons
- Categorized as **Warning**, **Critical**, or **Info**
